Argo Version 1.1.

Compile using Visual Studio 2013.
Requires the latest version of Eigen and Intel Thread Building Blocks (TBB).

The latest version of Eigen can be retreived from : http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/.
Similarly, the latest version of TBB can be retreived from : https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/.

The VS2013 Solution looks for a "tbb" and "Eigen" folder one directory above the solution's directory as such :

	Solution folder : "\Solution\Argo.sln"
	tbb folder : "\Solution\..\tbb"
	Eigen folder : "\Solution\..\Eigen"

Alternatively, you can configure the solution itself by manually setting the required include folders for the compiler and linker.
